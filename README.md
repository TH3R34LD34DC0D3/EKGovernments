# EKGovernments
A submod for the mod Elder KIngs, focusing on governments

Instal:
Unpack the ZIP folder either directly into your /mod folder or into a seperate folder, and pull the .mod file out of EKGovernments. Place the .mod file in the /mod folder alongside EkGovernments folder and baddabing baddaboom!

Summary:
This is a submod for the mod Elder Kings, focusing on governments for several different varieties of cultures and or religions. Current governments include but are not limited to; 
House Council for Dunmer, Ashkhanate for Ashlanders, Shorekhanate for Chimer, Dreaming Court for Sixth House Dagoth Ur Worshipers, and Elven Ceremoniarchy for Altmer.

Plans:
There is a plan to include other governments for Bosmer, Maormer, and Ayleids

Non Plans:
I do not plan on making governments for Imperials/Colovians/Nibenesse, Bretons, Kahjiit/Pellitinian/Anequinian, Quey, Falmer, Argonians, or Redguards within this mod. These may eventually change down the line if rhyme or reason give proof as to why I should remove Feudal even further, and if I can even get the resources to do them.

Dwemer:
Dwemer will be getting a spinoff mod focusing on more than just a Dwemer Government, a remake and overhaul of Mr. Samuel Streamers Dwemer Contingency, with full permissions. And of course, a ton of credit goes to Mr. Samuel Streamer for making most of the content for said mod, with me changing a few things to make it more in line with the original vision of Elder Kings. More to be revealed as the mod develops.

Pirates:
Pirates will be getting their own government, but to avoid any conflicts and or problems with this mod, as it is still very much a rough plan with a few ideas in mind, it will be a seperate mod. More to be revealed as the mod develops.

Dragon Cult:
Nords/Atmorans/Skaal will be getting content, but specifically for Dragon Cult followers. Due to the larger nature of changes planned, and to not conflict with this mod, it too will be a seperate mod. More to be revealed as the mod develops.
