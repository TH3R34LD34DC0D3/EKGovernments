Unpack the ZIP folder either directly into your /mod folder or into a seperate folder, and pull the .mod file out of EKGovernments. Place the .mod file in the /mod folder alongside EkGovernments folder and baddabing baddaboom!

Summary:
This is a submod for the mod Elder Kings, focusing on governments for several different varieties of cultures and or religions. Current governments include; 
House Council for Dunmer, Ashkhanate for Ashlanders, Shorekhanate for Chimer, Dreaming Court for Sixth House Dagoth Ur Worshipers, and Elven Ceremoniarchy for Altmer, Orgnumic Society for Pyandoneaic worshieprs, Sea Clans for non Pandoneaic Maormer, Bosmer Feudalism for elligible Bosmer, and Jungle Tribe for elligible Bosmer. 

Wrap Up:
Due to circumstances involving the original Elder Kings mod developers, I will not longer be continuing work on this submod. Though I wish to no longer be assosiated as a member of their community, I wish them the best of luck with the success of their mods, and hope they can get their heads out of their asses for the sake of their community. Thank you all for enjoying the mod!

Re-releasing:
I give permission for people to take these files and upload them to forums such as the Steam Workshop, or Paradox Forums should anyone be so inclined to. I only ask to be credited as the original author of the work. Same permissions and request apply should anyone be inspired to update and or change things about the mod and release it as a new version.

Future Plans:
I may or may not continue my work on other mods, or even vanilla mods, but at this time I am unsure of any plans. Should this change, I may or may not update this list, but if this list updates, then you will know then.
